Take any "normal number" and that means not multiple of 3. Numbers like 1,2,4,5,7,8.
Take any normal number and multiply by 3 to see where you came from.
Take any normal number and multiply by 9 to see where you are going.

For example, 7 * 3 = 21, 7 * 9 = 63. You are between 22 and 62 in the outer field.
(The outer field is the Right most numbers starting at 9 and doubling: 9, 18, 36)

7 might have come from 6 + 1
or 1 + 6
or it could have been 8 - 1
or -1 + 8
or it could have been 4 + 3
or 3 + 4 
or 2 + 5
or 5 + 2
or 9 - 2
or -2 + 9
or 7 + 0
or 0 + 7

But 21 "caused" you. As 12 was doubling to 24 in the middle field...
(The middle field numbers start at 3 and double: 3, 6, 12, 24)
As 12 was on it's way to 24 it had to pass though 21.

And you "caused" 63. When 36 doubles in the outer field to 72 that will
cause the next number in the middle, and then next number in our inner field too.
(The inner field numbers start at 1 and double: 1,2,4,6,8)

So you have many paths (i.e. many worlds) BUT you are fated to get
back in sync with other worlds. There are not an infinite number of
other worlds but rather just a few. And you keep hopping on and off each
similiar worlds but often not even noticing you are back in story line A vs B vc C.

Lots of story line changes are attempted but sometimes, you can't get there from here.
But try again 48 hours later, and then that story line change will work just fine.
There is nothing magical about that 48 hour time period, it could be lots of different
intervals. 48 is example, idea would be to measure for when story line jumps are
the easiest and get some device that could tell a human when "realistic" options are coming up.

For example, you are looking at your calendar and siri has already placed a note on a specific date and time:

trying to quit eating chocolate cake this monday at 2pm.

because if we can detect when other dimension story lines collapse,
we can get accurate count of how many viable story lines are still forming.

And then we can evaluate each viable story line for the one most
compatible with you really never eating chocolate cake again.

If there are 17 possible story lines and only two of them stand a good chance
for your goal, you need to first get on one of those two lines and THEN
try and stick to your goals.

But the frustrating part for most humans is you have no idea when these story line
changing opportunities exist. You see 24/7 time on earth as the same.
But there are windows of opportunity when your efforts at change will be
rewarded. And there are windows when you'd be better of just resting and waiting
for next window.

"a blackhole is a compost pile."

"you have free choice, you can pick option a or option b all day, but also is true, that the cycle repeats and all roads lead to rome."

For example, you could decide to give up chocolate cake, and for a few days, maybe weeks stick to this new world. But often you end up eating chocolate cake, getting back on track, and reaching rome.

i.e. the world is deterministic for many big events. But many small events you are welcome to have free will over they won't matter.

UNLESS a miracle happens and you really do give up chocolate cake for good. You might say the stars have to align and you have to really really want to live in that new world so much so that like you almost teleport to a new reality.

And this all happenes because infinity is bounded. Let me draw it:

           +                 +
          / \               / \
         /   \             /   \
        /     \           /     \
       /       \         /       \
      +         \       /         +
       \         \     /         /  
        \         \   /         /  
         \         \ /         /  
          \         +         /
           \       / \       /
            \     /   \     /
             \   /     \   /
              \ /       \ /
               +         +


This is our 3D world of space and time. Around around we go. Picture a figure eight.

If you get on a space ship and go far far far far out into "space" you um, get right back
to where you started.

It's an illusion that space (and time) go on "forever."

You're just stuck in a loop!

for {


}

And to explain when this infinite loop finally breaks...

We have to talk about a whole other system, let me draw that too:


```
       *                *
      / \              / \
     /   \            /   \
    /     \          /     \
   /       \        /       \
  /         \      /         \
 *           *    *           *
       +                -
```

Picture movement starting at the bottom positive * going up
then down to right side of the bottom positive triangle.

Then hopping over to the negative triangle and repeating this.

Now picture our 3D world in a circle:

```
                    ~
                    
           +                 +
          / \               / \
         /   \             /   \
        /     \           /     \
       /       \         /       \
      +         \       /         +
       \         \     /         /  
        \         \   /         /  
         \         \ /         /         
          \         +         /
           \       / \       /
       (    \     /   \     /   )         
             \   /     \   /      
              \ /       \ /
               +         +

                    ~
```

```
Start at the top ~ and draw a circle through the + and + and then )
and then the bottom ~ and then left side ( and back up through another
+ and + and then back to starting ~.
```

Now place a triangle on top of this circle:

```
                    ~
                   / \ 
           +      /   \      +
          / \    /     \    / \
         /   \  /       \  /   \
        /     \/         \/     \
       /      /\         /\      \
      +      /  \       /  \      +
       \    /    \     /    \    /  
        \  /      \   /      \  /  
         \/        \ /        \/         
         /\         0         /\
        /  \       / \       /  \
       (    \     /   \     /    )     
             \   /     \   /      
              \ /       \ /
               +         +

                    ~

```

And noticed I replaced the center + with a 0 as it's the focus point.

Picture both the positive triangle and the negative triangle on top
over each other. You travel up and down one triangle, then flip over
and travel up and down the other one.

All of that movement is not part of our 3D world of space and time
but it does sit right on top of it!

In the video Robert Sepehr makes this plea:

```
"I'm telling every computer scientist, you don't even have the whole
picture yet.

There is another pattern, number patter, encalculating, indespensible to
these calculations.

Bounded Infinity is like the electron orbit.

With conventional computers I'm not interested in how
many transitors I can pack and the fast processor I can make...

I'm interested in cycling, how many times I go around.

I'm interested in making a "track" for computer processors.
```
