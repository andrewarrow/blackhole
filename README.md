# blackhole

"a blackhole is a compost pile."

"you have free choice, you can pick option a or option b all day, but also is true, that the cycle repeats and all romes lead to rome."

For example, you could decide to give up chocolate cake, and for a few days, maybe weeks stick to this new world. But often you end up eating chocolate cake, getting back on track, and reaching rome.

i.e. the world is deterministic for many big events. But many small events you are welcome to have free will over they won't matter.

UNLESS a miracle happens and you really do give up chocolate cake for good. You might say the stars have to align and you have to really really want to live in that new world so much so that like you almost teleport to a new reality.

And this all happenes because infinity is bounded. Let me draw it:

           +                 +
          / \               / \
         /   \             /   \
        /     \           /     \
       /       \         /       \
      +         \       /         +
       \         \     /         /  
        \         \   /         /  
         \         \ /         /  
          \         +         /
           \       / \       /
            \     /   \     /
             \   /     \   /
              \ /       \ /
               +         +


This is our 3D world of space and time. Around around we go. Picture a figure eight.

If you get on a space ship and go far far far far out into "space" you um, get right back
to where you started.

It's an illusion that space (and time) go on "forever."

You're just stuck in a loop!

for {


}

And to explain when this infinite loop finally breaks...

We have to talk about a whole other system, let me draw that too:


```
       *                *
      / \              / \
     /   \            /   \
    /     \          /     \
   /       \        /       \
  /         \      /         \
 *           *    *           *
       +                -
```

Picture movement starting at the bottom positive * going up
then down to right side of the bottom positive triangle.

Then hopping over to the negative triangle and repeating this.
