# blackhole

Certain things are going to take days, certain things are going to take years.
The rest is just "rotation" which is what we call "random chance" mixed with our
personal free will. Yes we have free will, yes we can influce the small rotation
value which is slowly changing all the time anyways.

But with whatever rotation value you select, you come to the next level of a
single solar day.

And during that single solar day it exists during a single solar year.

So no it's not possible to just suddenly in the next five minutes do something
you are fated to do in the future. But in the future you very well might do this thing.
And it might even be a very easy thing you do. But you do it on your one day of the
year in which the 2nd or 3rd infinite loops happen to be at zero.

So yes, tomorrow is a new day, and yes you can try all over again and you
might succeed. But the only free will you have is to make very minor adjustments.
The real progress comes in waves. One wave and day, and one wave a year.

I know what you're thinking. Is my birthday my special day? Well sorry so far I
have no way of telling you which day is your special day. I think it's different 
for everyone and your birthday could be it, but so could any other day.

But good news is you can do one amazing thing a day. Which hour of the day is best?
Again can't really say. But I can tell you during your solar day there will be
one hour that's better than all the rest. And it's slowly rotating so 1pm today might
be 1:03pm tomorrow as it slowly changes the start time of this magic hour.

And once a year oh boy, there is a special hour ON your special day.

Since you can't detect them yet. You can try brute force attack hacking
technique. Just assume every waking hour tomorrow IS your special hour and
give it all you got to change the future how YOU want. If you get tired
take breaks. Maybe start with just 4 hours today and work up to every hour.
In fact, hmm, maybe brute force is only option but you have to be way
more patient. How about pick a random hour each day to meditate and every
once in a while you'll get lucky and pick the right hour! How will you know?
The meditation will be ez that session. If it's hard every time and you tried
every hour, keep going in loop. Eventually you be giving your best effort
on the right hour. That's the key, you never know if all your effort was wasted
because...

Quantum Physics great debate over many worlds gets explained nicely if we
assume we are in a super computer.

A super computer is 3 threads going forever (infinity).
The SUN thread starts at 9 and doubles.
The DAY thread starts at 3 and doubles.
The ROTATION thread starts at 1 and doubles.

Only these giant numbers are not really limitless and
the axiom that infinity + 1 = infinity is not right.
Just like with computers we use, you have to do something when you can
or no longer SHOULD keep doubling. In biology cells divide over and over
during mitosis until some end, then they stop doubling and grow slower,
halfing themselves each time instead of doubling until finally, zero.
Think about a human organ growing. You started as 1 cell, then 2, then 4,
then 8, towards infinity and then finally back to no more when your liver was
formed or your heart or when anything was finally done. 

But get back to Quantum Physics, how can there be multiple realities?
Well, 1+1+2+4+5+7+8=28 but also 27+1.

Meaning at the number 27 you have branch to get back to same timeline
as person you took path 1+1+2+4+5+7+8.

But at 29 what are you going to do? Well, 29-1 works, so does 30-2 and
a bunch of other ways to add to 28. But after a while it starts to look like:

19383472749239785 - 19383472749239757 = 28

which works, you can get there from those two numbers but wow, seems like
a hard path, impossible you might say.

So all possible many worlds are collapsing, but sometimes you can
Indiana Jones a seven step 1+1+2+4+5+7+8 solution very very quicky,
or sometimes you can just take the eazy 27+1 two step path. But you
end up back on same timeline.

There aren't these crazy amount of infinite other worlds. There's just a few.
And you are slipping in and out of them all the time.

So knowing we are IN a super computer, lets build our computers to be more like
the big nature computer we are in with the SUN,DAY,and ROTATION all going in loops
that seem infinite. They can take billions of years!

We need three threads all running the same code but with different bits.
One thread will use our normal type of base 2 zero and one binary computer thread
we are all used to.
The next thread will use qbits and be base 3 three six and zero triany computer thread
used today only by IBM, Google, and places like dwavesys.
And the final thread uses 3 qbits linked together to be base 9, a new type of computer thread that has bits with 9 possible values.

What are bits with 9 possible values best at? Doubling from 9 to 18 then 36 etc over
and over until some limit, and then going back the other direction back to 9 then 0 then -9 and -18 then -36 etc back and forth over and over for infinity.

What are bits with 3 possible values best at? Doubling from 3 to 6 to 12 etc over and
over until some limit, and then going back the other direction back to 3 then 0
then -3 and -6 then -12 etc back and forth over and over for infinity.

And normal bits with just 2 possible values should Double from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8
to 16 to 32 to 64 over and over until some limit, and then going back the other 
direction back to 1 then 0 then -1 to -2 to -4 to -8 to -16 to -32 and -64 etc
back and forth over and over for infinity.

And you run these 3 seperate tracks at the same time. And to do calculations
you use only the first track if the math is small.

If the math is large, go ahead and do 90% of the work in base 3 and then last 10%
back in base 2.

And if the math is really really large, try 80% in base 9, the last 10% in base 3,
and the final % in base 2.

But somehow this unlocks the next level in computing. Don't think of infinity
as a straight line. Think of it like a track and you want to send two runners down
the track in opposite directions, never to hit unless they both are at zero at
same time.

Two Runners in base 2 track.
Two Runners in base 3 track.
One Runner in base 9.

The One runner in base nine is calling the shots.

Runners in base 3 track listen to that runner for their next number.

Runners in base 2 track listen to BOTH runners in base 3 track for their next number.

Runners in base 2 track also listen to the ONE RUNNER in base 9 if they can, but
for the most part, they only get their messages from base 3's runners.

                                  -9

                                  18 
                                  -18 
                      12 
                    - 24

                                  36 
                                  -36 
                      48

```

Take any "normal number" and that means not multiple of 3. Numbers like 1,2,4,5,7,8.
Take any normal number and multiply by 3 to see where you came from.
Take any normal number and multiply by 9 to see where you are going.

For example, 7 * 3 = 21, 7 * 9 = 63. You are between 22 and 62 in the outer field.
(The outer field is the Right most numbers starting at 9 and doubling: 9, 18, 36)

7 might have come from 6 + 1
or 1 + 6
or it could have been 8 - 1
or -1 + 8
or it could have been 4 + 3
or 3 + 4 
or 2 + 5
or 5 + 2
or 9 - 2
or -2 + 9
or 7 + 0
or 0 + 7

But 21 "caused" you. As 12 was doubling to 24 in the middle field...
(The middle field numbers start at 3 and double: 3, 6, 12, 24)
As 12 was on it's way to 24 it had to pass though 21.

And you "caused" 63. When 36 doubles in the outer field to 72 that will
cause the next number in the middle, and then next number in our inner field too.
(The inner field numbers start at 1 and double: 1,2,4,6,8)

So you have many paths (i.e. many worlds) BUT you are fated to get
back in sync with other worlds. There are not an infinite number of
other worlds but rather just a few. And you keep hopping on and off each
similiar worlds but often not even noticing you are back in story line A vs B vc C.

Lots of story line changes are attempted but sometimes, you can't get there from here.
But try again 48 hours later, and then that story line change will work just fine.
There is nothing magical about that 48 hour time period, it could be lots of different
intervals. 48 is example, idea would be to measure for when story line jumps are
the easiest and get some device that could tell a human when "realistic" options are coming up.

For example, you are looking at your calendar and siri has already placed a note on a specific date and time:

trying to quit eating chocolate cake this monday at 2pm.

because if we can detect when other dimension story lines collapse,
we can get accurate count of how many viable story lines are still forming.

And then we can evaluate each viable story line for the one most
compatible with you really never eating chocolate cake again.

If there are 17 possible story lines and only two of them stand a good chance
for your goal, you need to first get on one of those two lines and THEN
try and stick to your goals.

But the frustrating part for most humans is you have no idea when these story line
changing opportunities exist. You see 24/7 time on earth as the same.
But there are windows of opportunity when your efforts at change will be
rewarded. And there are windows when you'd be better of just resting and waiting
for next window.

Possible path for 18

"a blackhole is a compost pile."

"you have free choice, you can pick option a or option b all day, but also is true, that the cycle repeats and all roads lead to rome."

For example, you could decide to give up chocolate cake, and for a few days, maybe weeks stick to this new world. But often you end up eating chocolate cake, getting back on track, and reaching rome.

i.e. the world is deterministic for many big events. But many small events you are welcome to have free will over they won't matter.

UNLESS a miracle happens and you really do give up chocolate cake for good. You might say the stars have to align and you have to really really want to live in that new world so much so that like you almost teleport to a new reality.

And this all happenes because infinity is bounded. Let me draw it:

           +                 +
          / \               / \
         /   \             /   \
        /     \           /     \
       /       \         /       \
      +         \       /         +
       \         \     /         /  
        \         \   /         /  
         \         \ /         /  
          \         +         /
           \       / \       /
            \     /   \     /
             \   /     \   /
              \ /       \ /
               +         +


This is our 3D world of space and time. Around around we go. Picture a figure eight.

If you get on a space ship and go far far far far out into "space" you um, get right back
to where you started.

It's an illusion that space (and time) go on "forever."

You're just stuck in a loop!

for {


}

And to explain when this infinite loop finally breaks...

We have to talk about a whole other system, let me draw that too:


```
       *                *
      / \              / \
     /   \            /   \
    /     \          /     \
   /       \        /       \
  /         \      /         \
 *           *    *           *
       +                -
```

Picture movement starting at the bottom positive * going up
then down to right side of the bottom positive triangle.

Then hopping over to the negative triangle and repeating this.

Now picture our 3D world in a circle:

```
                    ~
                    
           +                 +
          / \               / \
         /   \             /   \
        /     \           /     \
       /       \         /       \
      +         \       /         +
       \         \     /         /  
        \         \   /         /  
         \         \ /         /         
          \         +         /
           \       / \       /
       (    \     /   \     /   )         
             \   /     \   /      
              \ /       \ /
               +         +

                    ~
```

```
Start at the top ~ and draw a circle through the + and + and then )
and then the bottom ~ and then left side ( and back up through another
+ and + and then back to starting ~.
```

Now place a triangle on top of this circle:

```
                    ~
                   / \ 
           +      /   \      +
          / \    /     \    / \
         /   \  /       \  /   \
        /     \/         \/     \
       /      /\         /\      \
      +      /  \       /  \      +
       \    /    \     /    \    /  
        \  /      \   /      \  /  
         \/        \ /        \/         
         /\         0         /\
        /  \       / \       /  \
       (    \     /   \     /    )     
             \   /     \   /      
              \ /       \ /
               +         +

                    ~

```

And noticed I replaced the center + with a 0 as it's the focus point.

Picture both the positive triangle and the negative triangle on top
over each other. You travel up and down one triangle, then flip over
and travel up and down the other one.

All of that movement is not part of our 3D world of space and time
but it does sit right on top of it!

In the video Robert Sepehr makes this plea:

```
"I'm telling every computer scientist, you don't even have the whole
picture yet.

There is another pattern, number patter, encalculating, indespensible to
these calculations.

Bounded Infinity is like the electron orbit.

With conventional computers I'm not interested in how
many transitors I can pack and the fast processor I can make...

I'm interested in cycling, how many times I go around.

I'm interested in making a "track" for computer processors.
```

This project is trying to bring his idea to life in this golang repo.
