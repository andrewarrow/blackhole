# blackhole

"a blackhole is a compost pile."

"you have free choice, you can pick option a or option b all day, but also is true, that the cycle repeats and all romes lead to rome."

For example, you could decide to give up chocolate cake, and for a few days, maybe weeks stick to this new world. But often you end up eating chocolate cake, getting back on track, and reaching rome.

i.e. the world is deterministic for many big events. But many small events you are welcome to have free will over they won't matter.

UNLESS a miracle happens and you really do give up chocolate cake for good. You might say the stars have to align and you have to really really want to live in that new world so much so that like you almost teleport to a new reality.

And this all happenes because infinity is bounded. Let me draw it:

           +                 +
          / \               / \
         /   \             /   \
        /     \           /     \
       /       \         /       \
      +         \       /         +
       \         \     /         /  
        \         \   /         /  
         \         \ /         /  
          \         +         /
           \       / \       /
            \     /   \     /
             \   /     \   /
              \ /       \ /
               +         +
